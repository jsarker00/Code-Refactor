# Homework1
# Changed Title in line: 7
# Changed HTML tags to semantic (Semantic tags explain the purpose of the elements and also help search engines to read the page and find the required information faster.)
# Added alt="" to every img src respective to the img src name (Gives the link a title rather than being one long and confusing link)
# Added display flex (Content of the website stays within the parameters of the page repsected to the changes in size) 
# Added comments to simplify syntax (Help client better understand changes)
